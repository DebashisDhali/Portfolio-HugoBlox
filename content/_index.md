      text: "**Title: My Tech Journey: From Development to IoT Solutions**

       Hi, I‚Äôm Debashis Dhali, a 23-year-old Computer Science student at Jahangirnagar University. Starting with frontend development‚ÄîHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React‚Äîmy goal is to become a full-stack developer, hopefully at Google. To get there, I‚Äôm following a structured roadmap to deepen my skills across all aspects of web development.

       Beyond coding, I‚Äôm diving into IoT with projects aimed at solving local issues. Inspired by Bangladesh‚Äôs ‚ÄúMore Fish‚Äù project, I‚Äôm working on a device to monitor water quality in ponds, helping fish farmers increase yields. Another project automates the pre-exam process at my university, reducing time and effort for students through online applications and mobile banking.

       As I grow technically, I‚Äôm also committed to self-improvement, focusing on discipline and health. I document my journey through YouTube and blogging, sharing insights as I learn. Each project and challenge brings me closer to my vision of using tech to make a difference!"
