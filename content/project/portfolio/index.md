My **Responsive Web Design Portfolio** is a project I created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It showcases my skills and projects in a clean, modern, and fully responsive design.

Key features include:  
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all device sizes, from mobile to desktop.  
- **About Me Section**: Highlights my background, skills, and passion for web development.  
- **Projects Gallery**: Displays my work with project descriptions and links.  
- **Contact Section**: Easy-to-use form for connecting with me.

The portfolio demonstrates my ability to build responsive, user-friendly websites using **HTML** and **CSS**, adhering to clean coding practices and excellent design principles.
