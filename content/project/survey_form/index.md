The **Survey Form** is a project I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It focuses on creating a responsive and accessible survey form where users can submit their responses easily.

Key features include:  
- **Form Fields**: Multiple types of input fields, such as text, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.  
- **Clear Instructions**: Easy-to-understand labels and instructions for users.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to work seamlessly across devices of all sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience.  
- **Validation**: Basic client-side form validation to ensure users provide the correct information.

The form is built with **HTML** and **CSS**, adhering to clean design principles and focusing on user accessibility.
