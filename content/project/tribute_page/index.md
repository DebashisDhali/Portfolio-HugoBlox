The **Tribute Page** is a project I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It focuses on creating a visually appealing page dedicated to honoring a person or a cause.

Key features include:  
- **Personalized Design**: A clean, visually engaging design that highlights the person or cause being honored.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures the page displays properly on all devices, from mobile to desktop.  
- **Content Sections**: Includes sections like biography, images, and achievements that provide a comprehensive overview.  
- **Multimedia**: Incorporates images and links to enhance the user experience and provide more context.

The page is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with an emphasis on clean design and ensuring that the content is easy to read and navigate.
