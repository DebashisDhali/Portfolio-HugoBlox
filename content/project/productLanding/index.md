The **Product Landing Page** is a project I built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It focuses on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing landing page for a fictional product.

Key features include:  
- **Product Description Section**: Clear and concise information about the product, including features and benefits.  
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Prominent buttons for user engagement, such as "Buy Now" or "Learn More."  
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to work seamlessly across all devices, from mobile to desktop.  
- **Contact Form**: Easy-to-use form for users to inquire about the product or make purchases.

The page is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on a clean design, proper structure, and responsive design principles.
