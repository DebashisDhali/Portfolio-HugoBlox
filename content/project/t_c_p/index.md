The **Technical Documentation Page** is a project I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It focuses on creating a user-friendly and organized documentation page for a technical subject.

Key features include:  
- **Table of Contents**: A navigation bar that allows users to easily jump to different sections of the documentation.  
- **Code Examples**: Clear and readable code snippets displayed in proper syntax highlighting.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures the page is fully optimized for viewing across a variety of devices, from mobile to desktop.  
- **Clear Sectioning**: Properly structured sections for each topic, making it easy for users to find information.

The page is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on accessibility, readability, and clear organization.
